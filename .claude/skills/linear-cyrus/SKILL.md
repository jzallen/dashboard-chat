  Claude Code agent — running the Proposals→feature funnel, creating projects /
  Release milestones / stories / tasks, mapping nwave waves (discuss/distill/
  deliver) to Linear labels, promoting a proposal into a feature project,
  delegating sessions to @dashboard-chat, reviewing story PRs in Linear, or
  parallelizing work. Triggers: "linear", "cyrus", "proposal", "promote",

# Linear + Cyrus workflow

How we coordinate work on this repo: **Linear is the front door, cyrus is the
hands.** Planning, review, and merge live in Linear; cyrus turns a delegated issue
into a git worktree, runs a Claude Code session, and opens a GitHub PR you review and
merge **inside Linear** ([diffs](https://linear.app/docs/diffs)). This replaced the
gastown merge queue (retired 2026-06-15; parked in `.claude/retired-skills/gastown/`).

## Who does what — the core split

**cyrus thinks; the main session structures.** Tool-enforced:

- **dc-cyrus** has an **issue-only** Linear MCP → runs the **waves** (`nw-discuss`,
  `nw-distill`, `nw-deliver`); **cannot** create projects or milestones.
- The **main-session assistant** has the **full** Linear MCP (`save_project`,
  `save_milestone`, `save_issue`) → owns **structure**: projects, Release milestones +
  their git branches, **promotion**.

## The levels (one file each in `references/`)

```
Proposals project ── wave:discuss ──►  proposal enriched + stories as ANALYSIS in thread   (cyrus: nw-discuss, read-only)
      │  [main session] PROMOTE
      ▼
Feature project   = nwave feature
  └ Release (milestone)  → git <feature-slug>/<release> branch        (main session)
      └ Story  (issue)  ── phase flag: wave:distill → wave:deliver
          ·  wave:distill → cyrus decomposes into Task sub-issues + a Skeleton task first
          ·  (you review, relabel wave:deliver, @mention a comment)
          ·  wave:deliver → ONE builder session iterates the tasks → ONE story PR
              into the Release branch  (skeleton RED tests → green)
```

- **Story label is a phase flag.** `wave:distill` (awaiting breakdown) runs the
  orchestrator; relabel `wave:deliver` to run the builder. Mode comes from the **story's**
  label.
- **One PR per story** (story branch → Release branch); **no task branches/PRs** — tasks
  are the deliver session's plan, landed as commits. RED is transient on the story branch;
  the story PR gates the green end-state.
- **Skeleton-first:** the first task scaffolds + stubs signatures + writes the AC checklist
  as honest **RED tests**; implementation tasks turn them green (`skeleton-task.md`).
- **Release → main with no PR** (already reviewed via story PRs). Milestone progress
  tracked at the **story** level.
- **Status automation:** branch → In Progress, PR → In Review, merge → Done.

## Canonical lifecycle

1. Add a **proposal** issue to the **Proposals** project (`wave:discuss`).
2. Delegate dc-cyrus → `nw-discuss` (read-only) **produces the stories as analysis in the
   thread** — it can't create issues; the main session materializes them at promotion.
3. **Promote** (main session): Feature project + **Release milestones + `<slug>/<release>`
   branches**; move stories in (on their Release, `wave:distill`).
4. Per story: assign dc-cyrus → `nw-distill` decomposes into a **Skeleton task + impl
   tasks** with AC checklists.
5. Review the breakdown → **relabel the story `wave:deliver`** → **@mention a story
   comment** → one builder session delivers the whole story (skeleton-first), **one PR**
   into the Release branch.
6. Review + merge the story PR in Linear. Release done → merge `<slug>/<release>` → `main`.

Parallelize **across stories** (each its own session into the Release branch), not
tasks-within-a-story — tasks share the skeleton (see `parallel-execution.md`).

## Prerequisites (ops)

The cyrus daemon (`cyrus` on :3456) and a continuous SQS-mode pump must be running on the
devpod for delegations to drive sessions. See `references/triggering-sessions.md` and the
project memory `cyrus-local-running`.
